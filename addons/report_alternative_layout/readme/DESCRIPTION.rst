This module introduces an alternative layout for QWeb reports with the following
adjustments to existing external layouts:

- Displays the partner's address on the left side first, followed by the company's
  address on the right side.
- Displays the document's number and date in the header.
- Uses the commercial partner's address in place of the partner's address.

Currently, these adjustments are only supported for the standard external layout
(`external_layout_standard`).
